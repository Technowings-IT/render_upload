   - ⚙️ **Properties Panel** (right)

### 2. Load a Map
```
📂 Load Map → Select from:
• Existing JSON maps (converts to PGM)
• Previously saved PGM files
• Create new blank map
```

Medium: ●● (4-8 pixels) - General editing  
Large:  ●●● (9-15 pixels) - Quick coverage
```

### Map Values
- **Free Space** (255): White - robots can navigate
- **Obstacles** (0): Black - walls, furniture, no-go zones
- **Unknown** (128): Gray - unexplored areas

## 🔄 Workflow Example

## 🎨 Advanced Editing Tips

### Precision Editing
- Use **Grid** for pixel-perfect alignment
- **Zoom in** (200-400%) for detail work
- **Small brush** for fine corrections
- **Line tool** for straight walls

### Large Area Editing  
- **Large brush** for quick coverage
- **Flood fill** for rooms and open spaces
- **Rectangle tool** for regular shapes
- **Medium zoom** (100-150%) for overview

### Professional Workflow
```
1. 🔍 Zoom out → Plan overall changes
2. 🎯 Mark problem areas → Note what needs fixing
3. 🖌️ Rough editing → Block out major changes
4. 🔍 Zoom in → Refine details
5. 👀 Quality check → Verify navigation paths
6. 💾 Save versions → Keep backup copies
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Map too dark** | Increase brightness in properties |
| **Brush not working** | Check tool selection and brush size |
| **Undo not working** | Ensure you're in edit mode |
| **Deploy fails** | Verify robot connection and permissions |
| **Large file slow** | Try reducing map resolution |

### Performance Tips
- **Close other apps** for smoother editing
- **Save frequently** to prevent data loss
- **Use smaller brush** for better responsiveness
- **Reduce zoom** if editing becomes laggy

## 📊 Map Quality Guidelines

### Navigation Requirements
✅ **Good Map Characteristics:**
- Clear pathways (white) between rooms
- Accurate wall boundaries (black)
- Consistent obstacle marking
- Proper door representations
- No isolated free spaces

❌ **Avoid:**
- Thin passages (< robot width)
- Floating obstacles  
- Inconsistent wall thickness
- Missing door openings
- Excessive unknown areas

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All doorways are properly marked as free space
- [ ] Robot can navigate between all required areas
- [ ] No-go zones are clearly marked as obstacles
- [ ] Map resolution is appropriate for robot size
- [ ] Origin point is correctly positioned

## 🚀 Deployment Best Practices

### Pre-Deployment
1. **Test locally** with path planning
2. **Validate dimensions** match real environment  
3. **Check robot clearance** in narrow areas
4. **Backup existing map** before replacement

### Post-Deployment
1. **Monitor robot behavior** during first runs
2. **Check navigation accuracy** in edited areas
3. **Fine-tune** if needed based on performance
4. **Document changes** for team reference
